      <p>
        Hi! I'm bonzoycv, a technology enthusiast with many years of experience using Linux operating systems, with a
        special weakness for distro hopping. My journey in the open-source world has been completely self-taught with
        many "oops, I broke my system" moments. But hey, that's how you learn, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not installing one Linux distro or another and customizing my desktop environment, I'm probably
        immersed in the pixelated worlds of classic point-and-click adventure games, like Monkey Island, Grim Fandango,
        The Dig, or some more recent ones like Nightmare Frames.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides video games, I'm passionate about role-playing games both as a player and a GM. I'm currently running an
        Old School Essentials adventure for my friends. I also have a great weakness for B-movies (yes, I like those
        too), appreciating their unique charm and bizarre, nonsensical creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is my digital playground, a place where I can get excited about technology, practice setting up my
        server, and create my blog with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS. Here I can share my adventures with Linux and
        document my journey as I embark on creating my own adventure game.
        It's also my solution to combat my bad memory; I hope to use this space as a practical reference for those
        recurring problems in my multiple distro installations and as a diary on my learning path with tools like Godot
        and Aseprite. So whether you're a Linux lover, a game enthusiast, or just someone curious about how someone with
        no programming knowledge plans to create a game using Godot... welcome aboard!
      </p>
