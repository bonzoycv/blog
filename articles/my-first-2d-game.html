      <h2>My First 2D Game with Godot</h2>

      <p>Today I completed my first 2D game following the <a
          href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.x/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a>
        from the official Godot documentation. This achievement, although it may seem small, is very significant for
        me as it's the first step at the beginning of this long journey towards creating this small but
        ambitious personal project.</p>

      <h3>Familiarizing Myself with Godot's Interface</h3>
      <p>Getting started with Godot was an interesting experience. I could say that the interface is quite
        intuitive and the integrated tools facilitate the learning process. Learning to navigate the Scene Editor,
        adjust node properties, and manage resources was fundamental to understanding how
        Godot works and was perhaps the easiest and quickest part to grasp.</p>

      <h3>Introduction to GDScript</h3>
      <p>One of the most complicated aspects for someone like me with no real knowledge in the area of
        programming was getting to know GDScript, Godot's scripting language. Its
        simple syntax and direct integration with the engine make it perfect for beginners.
        Writing scripts to control character behavior and interactions in the game
        gave me an essential first contact with programming within Godot. I can't say that
        I would be able to create a game after doing this tutorial, I don't even think I would be able to
        replicate what I did upon completing this 2D game, but it did give me a broader perspective on how
        this language works and helped me understand in general terms what could be achieved if I were to
        master Godot a little better.</p>

      <h3>Challenges Encountered</h3>
      <p>Although the tutorial provided clear guidance, it wasn't without challenges. I found difficulties in
        implementing certain functionalities, such as collision detection and input event management.
        However, each obstacle overcome gave me a deeper understanding of how
        to solve some of these problems. This official tutorial is an excellent gateway to
        learning more about Godot.</p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>The next goal in my project is to address the implementation of mouse movement within
        a 2D scene for a point n' click game. This challenge will allow me to create the typical interaction
        of this type of game, which will be very useful in creating the scenes for the
        project I'm currently working on.</p>
