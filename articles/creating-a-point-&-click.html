      <p>Today I'm starting a personal adventure: creating a video game. As someone with no prior experience in
        programming or digital art, this project represents an enormous challenge and, at the same time, the
        realization of a long-postponed dream.</p>
      <p>Over the past few weeks, I've been working on the heart of the project: the story. Classic LucasArts graphic
        adventures have always been an inspiration, and now I'm setting out to create an interactive narrative in the
        purest style of classic 90s adventures, which will be filled with intriguing puzzles and memorable characters,
        or at least I hope so.</p>
      <h3>The tools that will help me in this adventure</h3>
      <p>As a Linux enthusiast for many years (I currently use Fedora 40), it was crucial to find cross-platform tools
        that would allow me to design and create the game on this operating system. After much research, I decided on
        the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The operating system:</strong> Fedora 40.</li>
        <li><strong>Trello:</strong> To organize and manage project tasks. Being a web-based tool, it works perfectly
          on any platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Aseprite:</strong> My choice for creating characters and backgrounds in pixel art, trying to
          capture the essence of classic adventures. Fortunately, it has a Linux version.</li>
        <li><strong>Godot:</strong> The game engine I'll use, chosen not only for its accessibility and open-source
          nature but also for its excellent cross-platform support, including Linux.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The choice of these cross-platform tools not only allows me to work comfortably in my Linux environment, but
        also facilitates the eventual distribution of the game on multiple operating systems.</p>
      <p>For now, my main focus is on learning. I'm immersed in courses and tutorials about these tools, while
        continuing to develop the GDD document, the story, and the puzzles that will bring this adventure to life. I'm
        aware that the road will be long and challenging, but I'm determined to persevere.</p>
      <p>This blog will be a kind of development diary, a space where I wish to capture my progress, the challenges I
        encounter, and the learning I achieve along the way. There is no deadline to complete this project; my goal is
        to enjoy the process and, with a bit of luck, turn this dream into reality.</p>
      <p>As I'm simultaneously in constant learning about the Linux world and its distributions, I plan to publish
        everything I consider relevant as a self-reminder, since my poor memory is my weak point. Anyway...</p>
      <p>Who knows? Maybe my experience will inspire others to dust off their own dreams, just as others inspired me.
