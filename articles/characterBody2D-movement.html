      <p>Finally, after weeks of frustration and moments of wanting to give up, I've managed to get my character to move
        horizontally with a simple mouse click. I know this might seem trivial to many, but for me, it's a huge
        milestone in my learning journey with Godot, especially because although there are many Godot tutorials and
        guides online, very few deal with the topic of movement through a simple left mouse button click.</p>

      <p>The objective seemed simple: make the character walk towards where the player clicks. But if there's one thing
        I've learned in these few weeks of game development with Godot, it's that what seems easy in theory can be a
        real headache in practice.</p>

      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First, I had to read and research how to generate movements in a character. For this, I was mainly reading
          Godot's documentation on the input event system. The 'InputEvent', but I also watched countless YouTube videos
          that helped me understand how I could achieve this movement.</li>
        <li>Then came the challenge of calculating the direction of the character's movement. A problem that took me a
          lot of effort to solve was how to limit the character's movement to a specific area of the scene.</li>
        <li>Finally, making the movement feel smooth and natural. No abrupt teleportations or robotic movements. All the
          sprites and backgrounds I used are free and I took them from itch.io.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After countless attempts, errors, and debugging, this is the code that finally worked, a simple code, maybe
        later I can improve it, but for now I'm satisfied with the result.</p>

      <p>This small achievement has taught me to understand the fundamentals of GDScript, and I hope to be able to
        understand this language better to write more and better code in Godot. The satisfaction of seeing your code
        working serves as great motivation to keep going. Now I must put what I've learned into practice or I'll end up
        forgetting it sooner rather than later, as usually happens to me every time I learn something new but don't use
        it for a while. When I want to pick it up again, I have to start from scratch. I'll try to make sure that's not
        the case this time.</p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Now that I have the basic movement, I've realized there's a lot to do. For example, two tasks come to mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add obstacle detection so it doesn't go through walls.</li>
        <li>Create an interaction system with objects in the scenario.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is just the beginning of my point and click adventure. I know there will be more challenges ahead, but for
        now, I'll take a moment to celebrate this small victory.</p>
