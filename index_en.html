        <h2>The Beginning of an Adventure: My Journey Towards Creating a 2D Point & Click Graphic Adventure</h2>
        <p class="date">September 12, 2024</p>
        <img src="./sources/ycv.png" alt="Imagen representativa de una aventura gráfica en pixel art"
          class="blog-entry-image">
        <p>Today marks the beginning of an exciting personal adventure: creating my own game. As someone with no prior
          experience in programming or digital art, this project represents an enormous challenge and, at the same time,
          the realization of a long-postponed dream.</p>
        <p>Over the past few weeks, I've been working on the heart of the project: the story. The classic LucasArts
          graphic adventures have always been an inspiration, and now I aim to create an interactive narrative in the
          purest style of the classic adventures from the 90s, which will be filled with intriguing puzzles and
          memorable characters.</p>
        <h3>The Tools That Will Help Me in This Adventure</h3>
        <p>As a long-time Linux enthusiast (I currently use Fedora 40), it was crucial to find cross-platform tools that
          would allow me to design and create the game on this operating system. After much research, I decided on the
          following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trello:</strong> To organize and manage project tasks. Being a web-based tool, it works perfectly
            on any platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Aseprite:</strong> My choice for creating characters and backgrounds in pixel art, capturing the
            essence of classic adventures. Fortunately, it has a Linux version.</li>
          <li><strong>Godot:</strong> The game engine I'll be using, chosen not only for its accessibility and
            open-source nature but also for its excellent cross-platform support, including Linux.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The choice of these cross-platform tools not only allows me to work comfortably in my preferred Linux
          environment but also facilitates the eventual distribution of the game across multiple operating systems.</p>
        <p>For now, my main focus is on learning. I'm immersed in courses and tutorials about these tools, while
          continuing to develop the story and puzzles that will bring this adventure to life. I'm aware that the road
          will be long and challenging, but I'm determined to persevere.</p>
        <p>This blog will be a kind of development diary, a space where I'll share my progress, challenges, and
          learnings. There's no deadline for completing this project; my goal is to enjoy the process and, with a bit of
          luck, turn this dream into reality.</p>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe my experience will inspire others to dust off their own dreams.</p>
        <p>Let the adventure begin!</p>

      <!-- Segunda entrada - Preparando el entorno de desarrollo: Instalación limpia de Fedora 40 -->

      <article class="blog-entry">
        <h2>Preparing the Development Environment: Clean Installation of Fedora 40</h2>
        <p class="date">September 21, 2024</p>
        <p>Before diving into game development, the crucial first step is preparing the desktop environment. I've chosen
          my favorite Linux distribution: Fedora, version 40. This choice is based on several factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's a mainstream distribution with extensive community support, which facilitates problem-solving.</li>
          <li>It offers a good balance between stability and innovation, using the latest software versions.</li>
          <li>I have previous experience with Fedora and feel comfortable with it.</li>
          <li>My hardware is highly compatible with this distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To start with a clean installation, I've developed two scripts that facilitate the process of backing up and
          reinstalling my applications. Here's the first script, which generates a list of installed applications:</p>
        <pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
# Name of the file where applications will be saved
OUTPUT_FILE="applications.txt"

# Function to get user-installed applications via DNF
get_dnf_apps() {
echo "User installed applications (DNF):" > "$OUTPUT_FILE"
dnf repoquery --userinstalled --queryformat '%{NAME}' | sort | uniq >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
}

# Function to get Flatpak installed applications
get_flatpak_apps() {
echo -e "\nFlatpak installed applications:" >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
flatpak list --app --columns=application | sort >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"
}

# Execute functions to get the list of applications
get_dnf_apps
get_flatpak_apps

echo "The list of user-installed applications has been saved in $OUTPUT_FILE"
        </code></pre>
        <p>After obtaining the list of applications, I proceed to format and install Fedora 40 from scratch. Once the
          system is installed and updated, I run the second script to reinstall all the applications:</p>
        <pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
# Name of the file containing the list of applications
INPUT_FILE="applications.txt"

# Function to install DNF applications
install_dnf() {
echo "Installing DNF applications..."
APPS_DNF=$(sed -n '/DNF:/,/Flatpak:/p' "$INPUT_FILE" | 
           grep -v "DNF:" | grep -v "Flatpak:" | tr '\n' ' ')
if [ -n "$APPS_DNF" ]; then
    sudo dnf install -y $APPS_DNF
else
    echo "No DNF applications found to install."
fi
}

# Function to install Flatpak applications
install_flatpak() {
echo "Installing Flatpak applications..."
APPS_FLATPAK=$(sed -n '/Flatpak:/,$ p' "$INPUT_FILE" | 
               grep -v "Flatpak:" | tr '\n' ' ')
if [ -n "$APPS_FLATPAK" ]; then
    for app in $APPS_FLATPAK; do
        flatpak install -y flathub $app
    done
else
    echo "No Flatpak applications found to install."
fi
}

# Check if the input file exists
if [ ! -f "$INPUT_FILE" ]; then
echo "The file $INPUT_FILE does not exist. Please run the application listing script first."
exit 1
fi

# Execute the installation functions
install_dnf
install_flatpak
echo "Application installation has finished."
        </code></pre>
        <p>I hope this information is helpful for those who want to perform a similar process of reinstalling
          applications on their Linux system. In upcoming entries, I'll share details about the game creation process,
          including the development of the story and puzzles I'm currently working on. Until next time!</p>
