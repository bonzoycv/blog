        <h2>The Beginning of an Adventure: My Journey Towards Creating a 2D Point & Click Graphic Adventure</h2>
        <p class="date">September 12, 2024</p>

        <p>Today marks the beginning of an exciting personal adventure: creating my own game. As someone with no prior
          experience in programming or digital art, this project represents an enormous challenge and, at the same time,
          the realization of a long-postponed dream.</p>
        <p>Over the past few weeks, I've been working on the heart of the project: the story. The classic LucasArts
          graphic adventures have always been an inspiration, and now I aim to create an interactive narrative in the
          purest style of the classic adventures from the 90s, which will be filled with intriguing puzzles and
          memorable characters.</p>
        <h3>The Tools That Will Help Me in This Adventure</h3>
        <p>As a long-time Linux enthusiast (I currently use Fedora 40), it was crucial to find cross-platform tools that
          would allow me to design and create the game on this operating system. After much research, I decided on the
          following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trello:</strong> To organize and manage project tasks. Being a web-based tool, it works perfectly
            on any platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Aseprite:</strong> My choice for creating characters and backgrounds in pixel art, capturing the
            essence of classic adventures. Fortunately, it has a Linux version.</li>
          <li><strong>Godot:</strong> The game engine I'll be using, chosen not only for its accessibility and
            open-source nature but also for its excellent cross-platform support, including Linux.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The choice of these cross-platform tools not only allows me to work comfortably in my preferred Linux
          environment but also facilitates the eventual distribution of the game across multiple operating systems.</p>
        <p>For now, my main focus is on learning. I'm immersed in courses and tutorials about these tools, while
          continuing to develop the story and puzzles that will bring this adventure to life. I'm aware that the road
          will be long and challenging, but I'm determined to persevere.</p>
        <p>This blog will be a kind of development diary, a space where I'll share my progress, challenges, and
          learnings. There's no deadline for completing this project; my goal is to enjoy the process and, with a bit of
          luck, turn this dream into reality.</p>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe my experience will inspire others to dust off their own dreams.</p>
        <p>Let the adventure begin!</p>
